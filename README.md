# IMDB database on postgreSQL

The IMDB database is a very popular database for testing purposes. It is a relational database with 7 tables. The database is available on [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/).

The idea of this project is to create a postgreSQL database with the same structure as the IMDB database. The database will be created using the [IMDB dataset](https://datasets.imdbws.com/).
