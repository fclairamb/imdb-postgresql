# IMDB database on postgreSQL

## Goal
Create a **reproductible** postgreSQL database from the IMDB dataset so that we can:
- Use it for testing purposes
- Update it easily
- Share it with the community
- Improve it by simply adding new SQL transformations commands

## About IMDB

The [IMDB database](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/) is a very popular database for testing purposes.

The database will have the same structure as the [IMDB dataset](https://datasets.imdbws.com/).
